Circuit and Simulation implemented on [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform.

**Start Simulation**
* Green **LED** blinks every 1sec.

* Yellow **LED** blinks every 10seconds as many times as the first digit of the tens shows(e.g 1 for 10, 2 for 20 etc.)

* Red **LED** shows the circuit's hold state,if button is pressed. **LEDS** and system-screen stop blinking but the watch keeps counting internally. Red **LED** starts blinking with a 0.5sec period (2Hz). If user presses button again, circuit continues its operation.

* If button is pressed for more than 1sec, system is reseted to initial values.
